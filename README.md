# README

This has now largely been superceeded by built-in VSCode functionality in
[release 1.1.0 (April 2016)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/vApril)

----

This small Visual Studio Code extension adds a "bash" command to VSCode that allows you to start git-bash with the current working folder 
as the VSCode workspace's root folder.

Press F1 and then type "bash" to start git-bash.exe.

**Note that you will need to have git-bash.exe on the environment path.**

**Enjoy!**

##Version 1.0.4
* Improved error checking when git-bash isn't on the path
* No longer opens an informational message when it opens git-bash (that you then have to close each time, which is annoying).
